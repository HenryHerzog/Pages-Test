My name is Henry and I am living with my wife Mia and our Ragdoll Kimi in Nob Hill, San Francisco. I work as a sales representative at Cloudflare and built this site to test the performance and security features that I am selling. As I am entirely new to programming & front-end development, I was looking for an easy way to set up my own site without having to worry about complicated runtimes, dependencies, databases etc.

To do so, I took advantage of the following free/ open source technologies:


* Static page written in: Go
* SSG: Hugo
* Theme made with &#10084; by [Djordje Atlialp](https://github.com/rhazdon)
* VCS: Git
* Source Code Editor: VS Code
* Hosted: AWS' Free Tier
* Powered and Secured by Cloudflare
